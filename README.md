You can't create wealth if you cannot control where you spend your money. This is a budgeting app created using react js. The 'database' used is the localstorage, so every budget and expense is saved in your browser's localStorage. You can create a budget, assign expenses to use in the budget and it automatically creates records and provides visual graphs to see how you spend your money.
